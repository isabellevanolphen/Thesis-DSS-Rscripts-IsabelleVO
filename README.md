# Thesis-DSS-Rscripts-IsabelleVO

*Thesis DSS*

These 26 R scripts contain the code I wrote for this thesis research.
The first file contains the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of the investor evaluation survey data.
It also shows the Multinomial logistic regression and Classification decision tree implementation.

The other 25 files contain the code I wrote to preprocess the OpenFace data for each pitch.
These files also contain the exploratory data analyses of all pitchers' and investors' OpenFace data.
Finally, the multidimensional drpfromts analysis is performed in all 25 files for each pitcher-investor combination.
The resulting Maximum recurrence rates are used as an independent variable in the first file.

Kind regards,

Isabelle
